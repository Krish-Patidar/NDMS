# Multi-Layer Natural Disaster Management System (NDMS)

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Multi-Layer Natural Disaster Management System (NDMS)** is a web-based disaster response coordination platform developed by **ByteSquad** during **Code Urja 1.0 Hackathon**. The project addresses the inefficiencies in disaster management by centralizing resources, tracking victims, and deploying help efficiently.

## 🛑 Problem Statement
When a natural disaster (earthquake, flood, or cyclone) strikes, coordination between government agencies, NGOs, and volunteers is inefficient. There is no centralized platform for organizing resources, tracking victims, and deploying help effectively.

### 🔍 Our Solution
We developed a **Multi-Layer Disaster Response Coordination System** that:
- **Collects & Visualizes Real-Time Data:** Aggregates information from government sources, IoT sensors, and citizen reports.
- **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Uses priority algorithms to match available rescue teams, medical units, and food supplies to affected areas.
- **Interactive Disaster Map:** Displays disaster-affected zones, roadblocks, and active relief camps.
- **Automated Emergency Alerts:** Sends SMS/WhatsApp notifications to affected citizens based on geolocation.
- **Volunteer Management System:** Allows users to register, verify their skills, and get assigned to appropriate tasks.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Java, Servlet, JSP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Libraries:** JSoup (for web scraping and API calls)
- **Other:** JDBC (for database connectivity)

## 📌 Features
✅ Real-time disaster data collection & visualization  
✅ Interactive map for disaster tracking  
✅ Automated geolocation-based emergency alerts  
✅ Optimized resource & volunteer allocation  
✅ Secure user authentication for volunteers & officials
